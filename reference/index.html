<h2 id="how-to-define-the-temporal-properties-of-the-model">How to define the temporal properties of the model</h2>
<h3 id="timesteps-and-periods">Timesteps and periods</h3>
<p>FlexTool has two different kinds of time varying parameters. The first one represents a regular timeline based on timesteps. The duration of each timestep can be defined by the user. There can be multiple timelines in the database - the user needs to define which timeline to use (and what parts of the timeline should be used, as will be explained later). The timestep names in the timeline are defined by the user - they can be abstract like 't0001' or follow a datetime format of choice. However, the timestep names between different timelines must remain unique (usually there should be only one timeline in a database and therefore no issues).</p>
<p>The second time varying dimension is <code>period</code>, which is typically used to depict assumptions about the future. One model can include multiple <code>solves</code> that the model will solve in sequence (to allow multi-stage modelling). Each solve can include multiple <code>periods</code> (so that the user can change parameter values for different parts of the future).</p>
<p>A parameter of particular type can be either constant/time-varying or constant/period-based. For example <code>inflow</code> is either a constant or time-varying, but it cannot be period-based.</p>
<h3 id="timeblocksets">Timeblocksets</h3>
<p>Timeblocks pick one or more sections from the <code>timeline</code> to form a <code>timeblockset</code>. Each timeblock defines a start and a duration. The aim of timeblocksets is to allow the modeller to create models with representative periods often used in the investment planning.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>model</strong>: model defines the sequence of solves to be performed (e.g. first an investment solve and then a dispatch solve)</li>
<li><em>solves</em>: sequence of solves in the model represented with an array of solve names.</li>
<li><em>discount_offset_investment</em>: [years] Offset from the period (often year) start to the first payment of the investment cost annuity.</li>
<li><em>discount_offset_operations</em>: [years] Offset from the period (often year) start to the payment of operational costs. </li>
<li><strong>solve</strong>: each solve is built from an array of periods (e.g. one period for 2025 and another for 2030). Periods use timeblocksets to connect with a timeline.</li>
<li><em>period_timeblockset</em>: map of periods with associated timeblocks that will be included in the solve. Index: period name, value: timeblockSet name.</li>
<li><em>realized_periods</em>: these are the periods the model will 'realize' - i.e., what periods will be reported in the results from this solve</li>
<li><em>invest_periods</em>: array of periods where investements are allowed in this solve (applies only to objects that can be invested in)</li>
<li><em>discount_years</em>: how far in the future each period is from the start of this solve (in years). Index: period, value: years.</li>
<li><em>solver</em>: choice of a solver (a list of possible values)</li>
<li><em>highs_method</em>: HiGHS solver method ('simplex' or 'ipm' which is interior point method). Should use 'choose' for MIP models, since 'simplex' and 'ipm' will not work.</li>
<li><em>highs_parallel</em>: HiGHS parallelises single solves or not ('on' or 'off'). It can be better to turn HiGHS parallel off when executing multiple scnearios in parallel.</li>
<li><em>highs_presolve</em>: HiGHS uses presolve ('on') or not ('off'). Can have a large impact on solution time when solves are large. </li>
<li><em>solve_mode</em>: a single shot or a set of rolling optimisation windows solved in a sequence (not functional yet, always a single shot).</li>
<li><strong>timeblockset</strong>: timeblocksets are sets of timeblocks with a start (from timeline) and a duration (number of time steps)</li>
<li><em>block_duration</em> a map with index <em>timestep_name</em> that starts the timeblock and value that defines the duration of the block (how many timesteps)</li>
<li><strong>timeline</strong>: continuous timeline with a user-defined duration for each timestep. Timelines are used by time series data.</li>
<li><em>timestep_duration</em>: a map with <em>timestep_name</em> as an index and <em>duration</em> as a value.</li>
<li><em>timeline_duration_in_years</em> Total duration of the timeline in years. Used to relate operational part of the model with the annualized part of the model.</li>
<li><strong>timeblockset__timeline</strong>: defines which timeline object particular timeblockset is using.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>'has_storage'</strong> - does the node represent a storage and therefore have a state: <em>yes</em> (if not defined, then no storage)</li>
<li><strong>'invest_method'</strong> - Choice of investment method: either <em>not_allowed</em> or then a combination of <ul>
<li><em>invest</em> and/or <em>retire</em> </li>
<li>investment limits for each <em>period</em> and/or for all periods (<em>total</em>) or <em>no_limit</em> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>'inflow_method'</strong> - choice how to treat inflow time series<ul>
<li><em>use_original</em> - does not scale the original time series (no value defaults here)</li>
<li><em>no_inflow</em> - ignores any inserted inflow time series</li>
<li><em>scale_to_annual_flow</em> - will scale the time series to match the <code>annual_flow</code> so that the sum of inflow is multiplied by 8760/<code>hours_in_solve</code></li>
<li><em>scale_in_proprotion</em> - calculates a scaling factor by dividing <code>annual_flow</code> with the sum of time series inflow (after it has been annualized using <code>timeline_duration_in_years</code>)</li>
<li><em>scale_to_annual_and_peak_flow</em> - scales the time series to match the 'annual_flow' target while transforming the time series to match the highest load with the 'peak_inflow'</li>

<h3 id="using-nodes-as-storages">Using nodes as storages</h3>
<p>FlexTool manages storages through nodes. A regular node maintains an energy/material balance between all inputs and outputs (<code>has_balance</code> set to <em>yes</em>). A storage node includes an additional state variable, which means that the node can also use charging and discharging of the storage while maintaining the energy balance. A storage node is created by setting <code>has_storage</code> to <em>yes</em> and by adding storage capacity using the <code>existing</code> parameter and/or by letting the model invest in storage capacity (<code>invest_method</code>, <code>invest_cost</code>, <code>invest_max_period</code>, <code>invest_max_total</code> and <code>invest_forced</code> parameters).</p>
<p>Since FlexTool allows different temporal structures (multi-periods, rolling optimization, etc.) there needs to be ways to define how the storages behave when the model timeline is not fully consequtive. By default, storages are forced to match start level to the end level within timeblocks. This is an acceptable setting for small storages that do not carry meaningful amounts of energy between longer time periods in the model.</p>
<p>There are three methods associated with storage start and end values: <code>storage_binding_method</code>, <code>storage_start_end_method</code> and <code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code>. 
- The most simple one of these is the <code>storage_start_end_method</code> and it overrides the other methods, since it forces the start and/or the end state of the storage to a predefined value based on the proportional parameters <code>storage_state_start</code> and <code>storage_state_end</code> (proportional means that the parameter needs to be set between 0-1 and will be scaled by the storage capacity in the model). These two parameters affect only the first and the last timesteps of the entire model (even when the model has more than one solve).
- <code>storage_binding_method</code> states how the storage should behave over discontinuities in the model timeline. Model timeline can have jumps for three different reasons: timeblocks, periods, and solves. If <code>storage_binding_method</code> is <em>bind_within_timeblock</em>, then the storage has to match the state of the storage between the beginning and the end of each timeblock. In effect, <strong>storage_state_at_start_of_timeblock</strong> equals <strong>storage_state_at_end_of_timeblock</strong> plus <strong>charging</strong> minus <strong>discharging</strong> minus <strong>self_discharge_loss</strong> at the last timestep. Similarly, <em>bind_within_period</em> will force the start and end between periods, but it will treat the jumps between timeblocks as continuous from the storage perspective (the storage will continue from where it was at the end of the previous timeblock). <em>bind_within_solve</em> does effectively the same when there are multiple periods within one solve. <em>bind_within_model</em> (NOT IMPLEMENTED 19.3.2023) will extend the continuity to multiple solves and force the end state of the storage at the end of the last solve to match the beginning state of the storage at the start of the first solve. Finally, <em>bind_forward_only</em> will force continuity in the storage state over the whole model without forcing the end state to match the beginning state.
- <code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code> is meant for models that roll forward between solves and have an overlapping temporal window between those solves (e.g. a model with 36 hour horizon rolls forward 24 hours at each solve - those 12 last hours will be overwritten by the next solve). In these cases, the end state of the storage will be replaced by the next solve, but it can be valuable to have some guidance for the end level of storage, since it will affect storage behaviour. There are three methods: <em>free</em> is the default and will simply let the model choose where the storage state ends (usually the storage will be emptied, since it would have no monetary value). <em>use_reference_value</em> will use the value set by <code>storage_state_reference_value</code> to force the end state in each solve to match the reference value. <em>use_reference_price</em> will give monetary value for the storage content at the end of the solve horizon set by the <code>storage_state_reference_price</code> parameter - the model is free to choose how much it stores at the end of horizon based on this monetary value.</p>
<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<p>Units convert energy (or matter) from one form to another (e.g. open cycle gas turbine), but the can also have multiple inputs and/or outputs (e.g. combined heat and power plant). The input nodes are defined with the relationship <code>unit--inputNode</code> while the output nodes are defined through the relationship <code>unit--outputNode</code>.</p>
<h3 id="defining-how-the-unit-functions">Defining how the unit functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code> to state the alternative where the unit becomes active</li>
<li>'conversion_method' to define the way unit converts inputs to outputs </li>
<li><code>startup_method</code> - Choice of startup method. 'Linear' startup means that the unit can start partially (anything between 0 and full capacity) but will face startup cost as well as minimum load limit based on the capacity started up. 'Binary' startup means that the unit is either off or fully on, but it is computationally more demanding than linearized startups.</li>
<li><code>minimum_time_method</code> - Not functional yet. Choice between minimum up- and downtimes (<empty>, <em>min_downtime</em>, <em>min_uptime</em>, <em>both</em>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-data-items-for-units">Main data items for units</h3>

<li>Technical: <code>efficiency</code>, <code>min_load</code>, <code>efficiency_at_min_load</code>, <code>min_uptime</code>, <code>min_downtime</code><ul>
<li><code>min_load</code> - [0-1] Minimum load of the unit. Applies only if the unit has an online variable. With linear startups, it is the share of capacity started up. Constant or time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economic: <code>startup_cost</code>, <code>fixed_cost</code> (fuel cost comes through the use of fuel commodities and other variable costs are defined for flows between unit and node, see below)</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="units-constrained-by-profiles">Units constrained by profiles</h3>
<p>Some generators (e.g. VRE) are not converting energy from one node to the other. Instead, their generation is determined (or limited) by a specific generation profile set by a <code>profile</code> object with a <code>profile_method</code>, thats state whether the profile forces an <em>upper_limit</em>, <em>lower_limit</em> or <em>equal</em>ity. Finally <code>profile</code> object is given a <code>profile</code> time series (or it can also be a constant). One needs to use <code>node__profile</code>, <code>unit__node__profile</code> or <code>connection__profile</code> to apply the profile to specific energy flow (or storage state in the case of <code>node__profile</code>).</p>
<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>
<p>Connections can have an <code>existing</code> transfer capacity as well as an opportunity to invest in new capacity and retire old capacity. The functional choices of connections include the <code>is_active</code>, <code>transfer_method</code>, <code>invest_method</code>, <code>startup_method</code> as well as a choice if the tranfer connection <code>is_DC</code>. Parameters for the connection are defined in the <code>connection</code> object, but the two <code>nodes</code> it connects are defined by establishing a relationship between <code>connection--leftNode--rightNode</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>existing</code> - [MW] Existing capacity. Constant.</li>
<li><code>efficiency</code> - [factor, typically between 0-1] Efficiency of a connection. Constant or time.</li>
<li><code>constraint_capacity_coefficient</code> - A map of coefficients (Index: constraint name, value: coefficient) to represent the participation of the connection capacity in user-defined constraints.  [(invest - divest variable) x coefficient] will be on the left side of the equation. Invest and divest variables are not multiplied by unitsize.</li>

<li><code>is_DC</code> - A flag whether the connection is DC (the flow will not be counted as synchronous if there is a <em>non_synchronous_limit</em>). Default false.</li>
<li><code>virtual_unitsize</code> - [MW] Size of single connection - used for integer (lumped) investments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commodities">Commodities</h2>
<p>Some <code>nodes</code> can act as a source or a sink of commodities instead of forcing a balance between inputs and outputs. To make that happen, commodities must have a <code>price</code> and be connected to those <code>nodes</code> that serve (or buy) that particular <code>commodity</code> at the given <code>price</code>. In other words, <code>commodity</code> is separate from <code>node</code> so that the user can use the same <code>commodity</code> properties for multiple nodes. Commodities can also have a <code>co2_content</code>. The <code>commodity</code> and its <code>nodes</code> are connected by establishin a new relationship between the <code>commodity</code> and each of its <code>nodes</code> (e.g. <em>coal--coal_market</em>).</p>
<p><img alt="image-1.png" src="../commodities.PNG" /></p>
<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
<p>Groups are used to make constraints that apply to a group of nodes, units and/or connections. A group is defined by creating a group object and then creating a relationship between the group and its members. The membership relationship classes are <code>group__node</code>, <code>group__unit</code>, <code>group__connection</code>, <code>group__unit__node</code>, <code>group__connection__node</code> and <code>reserve__upDown__group</code>. The choice of group members depends on what the group is trying to achieve. For instance a group that limits investments could have a set of <code>units</code> included in the group.</p>
<h3 id="capacity-limits-for-nodes-units-and-connections">Capacity limits for nodes, units and connections</h3>

The average value is multiplied by the model duration to get the cumulative limit (e.g. by 8760 if a single year is modelled). Applied for each solve. Constant or period.</li>
<li><code>min_cumulative_flow</code> - [MW] Minimum average flow, which limits the cumulative flow for a group of connection_nodes and/or unit_nodes.

</ul>
<h3 id="controlling-outputs">Controlling outputs</h3>
<p>Some results are output for groups of nodes. This means that instead of getting output for each node separately, nodes can be grouped and the aggregated results can be examined. For example all electricity nodes could be groupped for aggragated output.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>output_results</code> - A flag to output aggregated results for the group members.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reserves">Reserves</h2>
<p>The user defines reserve categories through <code>reserve</code> object. Reserves are reservations of capacity (either upward or downward) and that capacity will not therefore be available for other use (flowing energy or commodities). There are three different ways how a reserve requirement can be calculated: timeseries, large_failure and dynamic. 
- Timeseries requires that the user provides a pre-defined time series for the amount of reserve to be procured in each time step. 
- Large_failure requires that the user defines the energy flows that could be the largest failure in the system. The highest possible failure (flow multiplied by <code>large_failure_ratio</code>) in each timestep will then set the reserve requirement for that timestep. 
- Dynamic means that there is a requirement based on user chosen energy flows - each participating flow is multipled by <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> and then summed to form the reserve requirement. This can be useful for covering variability within timesteps. Also demand variability can be included through <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> parameter in <code>reserve__upDown__group</code> relationship.</p>
<p>When the same reserve category (e.g. primary upward) has more than one of these (timeseries, large_failure and dynamic) in use, then the largest requirement will apply for that timestep. If they are separated into different reserves, then they need to be fulfilled separately.</p>
<p>Reserve requirement is defined for groups of nodes. This means that multiple nodes can have a common reserve requirement (but it is also possible to make a group with only one node). One node can be in multiple groups and therefore subject to multiple overlapping reserve requirements. Only units can generate reserve, but connections can move reserve from one node to another (therefore, there is no impact if the nodes are in the same reserve group, but it can be useful to import reserve from outside the group).</p>
<h3 id="reserve-groups">Reserve groups</h3>
<p>For <code>reserve__upDown__group</code> relationships:
- <code>reserve_method</code> - Choice of reserve method (timeseries, large_failure, dynamic or their combination).
- <code>reservation</code> - [MWh] Amount of reserve required. Constant or time.
- <code>reserve_penalty</code> - [€/MWh] Penalty cost for not fulfilling the reserve requirement.
- <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> - [factor] The reserve is increased by the sum of demands from the group members multiplied by this ratio. Constant.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-provision-by-units">Reserve provision by units</h3>
<p>For <code>reserve__upDown__unit__node</code> relationships:
- <code>is_active</code> - Can the unit provide this reserve. Empty indicates not allowed. Use 'yes' to indicate true.
- <code>max_share</code> - [factor] Maximum ratio for the transfer of reserve from the unit to the node. Constant.
- <code>reliability</code> - [factor] The share of the reservation that is counted to reserves (sometimes reserve sources are not fully trusted). Constant.
- <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> - [factor] The share of the reservation that is counted to reserves (sometimes reserve sources are not fully trusted). Constant.

<h3 id="reserve-transfer-by-connections">Reserve transfer by connections</h3>
<p>For <code>reserve__upDown__connection__node</code> relationships:
