<h2 id="how-to-define-the-temporal-properties-of-the-model">How to define the temporal properties of the model</h2>
<h3 id="timesteps-and-periods">Timesteps and periods</h3>
<p>FlexTool has two different kinds of time varying parameters. The first one represents a regular timeline based on timesteps. The duration of each timestep can be defined by the user. There can be multiple timelines in the database - the user needs to define which timeline to use (and what parts of the timeline should be used, as will be explained later). The timestep names in the timeline are defined by the user - they can be abstract like 't0001' or follow a datetime format of choice. However, the timestep names between different timelines must remain unique (usually there should be only one timeline in a database and therefore no issues).</p>
<p>The second time varying dimension is <code>period</code>, which is typically used to depict assumptions about the future. One model can include multiple <code>solves</code> that the model will solve in sequence (to allow multi-stage modelling). Each solve can include multiple <code>periods</code> (so that the user can change parameter values for different parts of the future).</p>
<p>A parameter of particular type can be either constant/time-varying or constant/period-based. For example <code>inflow</code> is either a constant or time-varying, but it cannot be period-based.</p>
<h3 id="timeblocksets">Timeblocksets</h3>
<p>Timeblocks pick one or more sections from the <code>timeline</code> to form a <code>timeblockset</code>. Each timeblock defines a start and a duration. The aim of timeblocksets is to allow the modeller to create models with representative periods often used in the investment planning.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>model</code>: model defines the sequence of solves to be performed (e.g. first an investment solve and then a dispatch solve)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>solves</em>: sequence of solves in the model represented with an array of solve names.</p>
</li>
<li><em>discount_offset_investment</em>: [years] Offset from the period (often year) start to the first payment of the investment cost annuity.</li>
<li>
<p><em>discount_offset_operations</em>: [years] Offset from the period (often year) start to the payment of operational costs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>solve</code>: each solve is built from an array of periods (e.g. one period for 2025 and another for 2030). Periods use timeblocksets to connect with a timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>period_timeblockset</em>: map of periods with associated timeblocks that will be included in the solve. Index: period name, value: timeblockSet name.</p>
</li>
<li><em>realized_periods</em>: these are the periods the model will 'realize' - i.e., what periods will be reported in the results from this solve</li>
<li><em>realized_invest_periods</em> Array of the periods that will realize the investment decisions. If this is not defined when the invest_periods exist, the realized_periods are used to realize the invests as well</li>
<li><em>invest_periods</em>: array of periods where investements are allowed in this solve (applies only to objects that can be invested in)</li>
<li><em>years_represented</em>: Map to indicate how many years the period represents before the next period in the solve. Used for discounting. Can be below one (multiple periods in one year). Index: period, value: years.</li>
<li><em>solver</em>: choice of a solver ('highs'(default), 'glpsol', 'cplex' (requires a licence))</li>
<li><em>highs_method</em>: HiGHS solver method ('simplex' or 'ipm' which is interior point method). Should use 'choose' for MIP models, since 'simplex' and 'ipm' will not work.</li>
<li><em>highs_parallel</em>: HiGHS parallelises single solves or not ('on' or 'off'). It can be better to turn HiGHS parallel off when executing multiple scnearios in parallel.</li>
<li><em>highs_presolve</em>: HiGHS uses presolve ('on') or not ('off'). Can have a large impact on solution time when solves are large. </li>
<li><em>solve_mode</em>: a single solve or a set of rolling optimisation windows solved in a sequence </li>
<li>
<p>Rolling window parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>rolling_start_time</em>: (Optional) Timestamp from the timeline that is linked to the timeblockSet used. Starting point of the rolling. If this is not stated, it is assumed to be the first timestep</li>
<li><em>rolling_solve_jump</em>: Hours, (Required if rolling_window solve). Interval between the start points of the rolls. Also the output interval. This should be smaller than the horizon</li>
<li><em>rolling_solve_horizon</em>: Hours, (Required if rolling_window solve). The length of the horizon of the roll. How long into the future the roll sees. For an individual roll, horizon is the solve length and jump is the output length.</li>
<li><em>rolling_duration</em>: Hours, (Optional). Duration of rolling, if not stated, assumed to be the whole timeline of the solve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nested solve sequence parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>contains_solve</em>: Array of solves that are run with after this solve using the realized data of this solve. Read 'How to use Nested Rolling window solves (investments and long term storage)'</li>
<li><em>fix_storage_periods</em>: Array of periods where the last storage value of the long term storage node is passed to the contained solve as a target. (Defined using the node parameter <code>storage_nested_fix_method</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For commercial solvers:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>solver_precommand</em> the commandline text in front of the call for the commercial (CPLEX) solver. For a possibility of reserving a floating licence for the duration of the solve</li>
<li><em>solver_arguments</em> Array of additional commands passed to the commercial solver. Made for setting optimization parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>timeblockset</code>: timeblocksets are sets of timeblocks with a start (from timeline) and a duration (number of time steps)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>block_duration</em> a map with index <em>timestep_name</em> that starts the timeblock and value that defines the duration of the block (how many timesteps)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>new_stepduration</em>: Hours. Creates a new <code>timeline</code> from the old for this <code>timeblockSet</code> with this timestep duration. The new timeline will sum or average the other timeseries data like <code>profile</code> and <code>inflow</code> for the new timesteps. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>timeline</code>: continuous timeline with a user-defined duration for each timestep. Timelines are used by time series data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>timestep_duration</em>: a map with <em>timestep_name</em> as an index and <em>duration</em> as a value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>timeline_duration_in_years</em> Total duration of the timeline in years. Used to relate operational part of the model with the annualized part of the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>timeblockset__timeline</code>: defines which timeline object particular timeblockset is using.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="using-nodes-as-storages">Using nodes as storages</h3>
<p>FlexTool manages storages through nodes. A regular node maintains an energy/material balance between all inputs and outputs (<code>has_balance</code> set to <em>yes</em>). A storage node includes an additional state variable, which means that the node can also use charging and discharging of the storage while maintaining the energy balance. A storage node is created by setting <code>has_storage</code> to <em>yes</em> and by adding storage capacity using the <code>existing</code> parameter and/or by letting the model invest in storage capacity (<code>invest_method</code>, <code>invest_cost</code>, <code>invest_max_period</code>, <code>invest_max_total</code> and <code>invest_forced</code> parameters).</p>
<p>Since FlexTool allows different temporal structures (multi-periods, rolling optimization, etc.) there needs to be ways to define how the storages behave when the model timeline is not fully consequtive. By default, storages are forced to match start level to the end level within timeblocks. This is an acceptable setting for small storages that do not carry meaningful amounts of energy between longer time periods in the model.</p>
<p>There are three methods associated with storage start and end values: <code>storage_binding_method</code>, <code>storage_start_end_method</code> and <code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The most simple one of these is the <code>storage_start_end_method</code> and it overrides the other methods, since it forces the start and/or the end state of the storage to a predefined value based on the proportional parameters <code>storage_state_start</code> and <code>storage_state_end</code> (proportional means that the parameter needs to be set between 0-1 and will be scaled by the storage capacity in the model). These two parameters affect only the first and the last timesteps of the entire model (even when the model has more than one solve).</li>
<li><code>storage_binding_method</code> states how the storage should behave over discontinuities in the model timeline. Model timeline can have jumps for three different reasons: timeblocks, periods, and solves. If <code>storage_binding_method</code> is <em>bind_within_timeblock</em>, then the storage has to match the state of the storage between the beginning and the end of each timeblock. In effect, <strong>storage_state_at_start_of_timeblock</strong> equals <strong>storage_state_at_end_of_timeblock</strong> plus <strong>charging</strong> minus <strong>discharging</strong> minus <strong>self_discharge_loss</strong> at the last timestep. Similarly, <em>bind_within_period</em> will force the start and end between periods, but it will treat the jumps between timeblocks as continuous from the storage perspective (the storage will continue from where it was at the end of the previous timeblock). <em>bind_within_solve</em> does effectively the same when there are multiple periods within one solve. <em>bind_within_model</em> (NOT IMPLEMENTED 19.3.2023) will extend the continuity to multiple solves and force the end state of the storage at the end of the last solve to match the beginning state of the storage at the start of the first solve. Finally, <em>bind_forward_only</em> will force continuity in the storage state over the whole model without forcing the end state to match the beginning state.</li>
<li><code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code> is meant for models that roll forward between solves and have an overlapping temporal window between those solves (e.g. a model with 36 hour horizon rolls forward 24 hours at each solve - those 12 last hours will be overwritten by the next solve). In these cases, the end state of the storage will be replaced by the next solve, but it can be valuable to have some guidance for the end level of storage, since it will affect storage behaviour. There are three methods: <em>free</em> is the default and will simply let the model choose where the storage state ends (usually the storage will be emptied, since it would have no monetary value). <em>use_reference_value</em> will use the value set by <code>storage_state_reference_value</code> to force the end state in each solve to match the reference value. <em>use_reference_price</em> will give monetary value for the storage content at the end of the solve horizon set by the <code>storage_state_reference_price</code> parameter - the model is free to choose how much it stores at the end of horizon based on this monetary value.</li>

<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<p>Units convert energy (or matter) from one form to another (e.g. open cycle gas turbine), but the can also have multiple inputs and/or outputs (e.g. combined heat and power plant).

<h3 id="discount-calculations">Discount calculations</h3>
<p>Each asset that can be invested in should have <code>invest_cost</code>, <code>lifetime</code> and <code>interest_rate</code> parameters set and could have an optional <code>fixed_cost</code>. These are used to calculate the annuity of the investment. Annuity is used to annualize the investment cost, since FlexTool scales all costs (operational, investment and fixed) to annual level in order to make them comparable. Annuity is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><code>invest_cost</code> * <code>interest_rate</code> / { 1 - [ 1 / ( 1 + <code>interest_rate</code> ) ] ^ <code>lifetime</code> } + <code>fixed_cost</code></p>
<p>The next step is to consider discounting - future is valued less than the present. There is a model-wide assumption for the <code>discount_rate</code>. By default it is 0.05 (i.e. 5%), but it can be changed through the <code>discount_rate</code> parameter set for the <em>flexTool</em> <code>model</code> object. Discount factor for every period in the model is calculated from the <code>discount_rate</code> using the <code>years_represented</code> parameter of each <code>solve</code>, which how many years the period represents. Values for <code>years_represented</code> are used to calculate how many <code>years_from_solve_start</code> each year is. The formula is:</p>
<p>[ 1 / ( 1 + <code>discount_rate</code> ) ] ^ <code>years_from_solve_start</code></p>
<p>Operational costs are also discounted using the same <code>discount_rate</code>. However, with operational costs it is assumed that they take place on average at the middle of the year whereas investment costs are assumed to take place at the beginning of the year (they are available for the whole year). These can be tweaked with the <code>discount_offset_investments</code> and <code>discount_offset_operations</code> parameters (given in years). Please note that given this formulation, <strong><code>invest_cost</code> should be the overnight built cost</strong> (as is typical in energy system modelling, the model does not assume any construction time - the financing costs of the construction period need to be included in your cost assumptions).</p>
<p>The model has a model horizon based on the <code>years_represented</code> parameters. The model will not include discounted investment annuities after the model horizon (in other words, the investments are 'returned' at the end of the model horizon). Naturally also operational costs are included only until the end of the model horizon. </p>
<p>Finally, the retirements work similar to investments using the same <code>discount_rate</code> and <code>interest_rate</code> parameters but with <code>salvage_value</code> as the benefit from retiring the unit.</p>

<h3 id="units-constrained-by-profiles">Units constrained by profiles</h3>
<p>Some generators (e.g. VRE) are not converting energy from one node to the other. Instead, their generation is determined (or limited) by a specific generation profile set by a <code>profile</code> object with a <code>profile_method</code>, thats state whether the profile forces an <em>upper_limit</em>, <em>lower_limit</em> or <em>equal</em>ity. Finally <code>profile</code> object is given a <code>profile</code> time series (or it can also be a constant).

<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>

<h2 id="commodities">Commodities</h2>
<p>Some <code>nodes</code> can act as a source or a sink of commodities instead of forcing a balance between inputs and outputs.

<h2 id="reserves">Reserves</h2>
<p>The user defines reserve categories through <code>reserve</code> object. Reserves are reservations of capacity (either upward or downward) and that capacity will not therefore be available for other use (flowing energy or commodities). There are three different ways how a reserve requirement can be calculated: timeseries, large_failure and dynamic. 
- Timeseries requires that the user provides a pre-defined time series for the amount of reserve to be procured in each time step. 
- Large_failure requires that the user defines the energy flows that could be the largest failure in the system. The highest possible failure (flow multiplied by <code>large_failure_ratio</code>) in each timestep will then set the reserve requirement for that timestep. 
- Dynamic means that there is a requirement based on user chosen energy flows - each participating flow is multipled by <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> and then summed to form the reserve requirement. This can be useful for covering variability within timesteps. Also demand variability can be included through <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> parameter in <code>reserve__upDown__group</code> relationship.</p>
<p>When the same reserve category (e.g. primary upward) has more than one of these (timeseries, large_failure and dynamic) in use, then the largest requirement will apply for that timestep. If they are separated into different reserves, then they need to be fulfilled separately.</p>
<p>Reserve requirement is defined for groups of nodes. This means that multiple nodes can have a common reserve requirement (but it is also possible to make a group with only one node). One node can be in multiple groups and therefore subject to multiple overlapping reserve requirements. Only units can generate reserve, but connections can move reserve from one node to another (therefore, there is no impact if the nodes are in the same reserve group, but it can be useful to import reserve from outside the group).</p>
<h3 id="reserve-groups">Reserve groups</h3>

- <code>reserve_method</code> - Choice of reserve method (timeseries, large_failure, dynamic or their combination).

- <code>increase_reserve_ratio</code> - [factor] The reserve requirement is increased by the flow between the unit and the node multiplied by this ratio. Constant.
