## Main alternatives to use IRENA FlexTool

- The easiest way is through a webpage when someone is running a server with IRENA FlexTool. You need an account from the manager of the server.
- You can also setup a local server yourself and then use the IRENAL FlexTool browser interface to access your own server. See https://github.com/irena-flextool/flextool-web-interface
- Install Spine Toolbox and run IRENA FlexTool as a Spine Toolbox project. This gives you the graphical user interface of Spine Toolbox. https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox
- It is also possible to define all the data in Excel and execute IRENA FlexTool workflows that takes the data from Excel and returns results in another Excel file. This functionality is still under development.
