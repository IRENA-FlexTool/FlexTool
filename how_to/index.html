<p>How to section contains examples on how to include common energy system components in your model. The examples assume that you have sufficient understanding of FlexTool basics (e.g. by doing the tutorial).
Each example will either include an example database file that is located in the 'how to examples databases' folder or the example is included in the init.sqlite as a scenario. If the example is in its own database, you can switch to that database by selecting the 'input' data store in the workflow and then changing the database by clicking the folder icon next to the current database file path in the 'Data store properties' widget. Navigate to the 'how to example databases' folder and choose the appropriate database.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-pv-wind-or-run-of-river-hydro-power-plant">How to create a PV, wind or run-of-river hydro power plant</h2>
<p><strong>(init.sqlite scenario: wind)</strong>
<strong><em>init - west - wind</em></strong></p>
<p>These three power plant types don't use any commodities (i.e. fuels), but are instead dependant on a timeseries profile.
To create these plants one needs an output node, an unit and a profile.</p>
<p>The unit only needs parameters:
- <code>is_active</code>: <em>yes</em>
- <code>existing</code>: [The maximum capacity of the plant] 
Additionally these parameters should be at their default values:
- <code>conversion_method</code>: <em>constant_efficiency</em>
- <code>efficiency</code>: 1</p>
<p>The <code>profile</code> object only has one parameter: <code>profile</code>. It is a timeseries map which tells what fraction of the capacity the plant can produce at each timestep.</p>
<p>The relationships 
- <code>unit__outputnode</code>: (plant|output node) and 
- <code>unit__node__profile</code>: (plant|output node|profile) need to be both created.</p>
<p>The <code>unit__node__profile</code> relationship needs a parameter <code>profile_method</code> that has three options: <code>upper_limit</code>, <code>lower_limit</code> and <code>exact</code>. It states how the profile is considered. In most cases the <code>upper_limit</code> option should be used as it allows the plant to curtail the production if there is more supply than demand. Otherwise the output node might have to use <code>downward_penalty</code> to spill energy.</p>
<p>The same profile can be used for multiple <code>unit__outputnode</code>s (and that is why the profile is not a unit parameter but its own entity).</p>
<p><img alt="Add another unit" src="../add_unit2.png" /></p>
<h2 id="how-to-connect-nodes-in-the-same-energy-network">How to connect nodes in the same energy network</h2>
<p><strong>(connections.sqlite)</strong></p>
<p>Typically nodes are used to maintain an energy balance and therefore they are used to represent a location with demand or a storage. The nodes can pass energy to each other through a connection entity. This is often an electricity connection but it can be any form of energy (or matter)  moving between two nodes. To create a connection one needs:
- two <code>nodes</code> 
- <code>connection</code>
- relationship <code>connection__node__node</code> to tie these three together.</p>
<p>The connection needs the parameters:
- <code>is_active</code>: <em>yes</em>
- <code>existing</code>: The maximum capacity of the connection [MW]. Applies to both directions.
- <code>efficiency</code>: represents the losses in transferring the energy. Same in both directions.</p>
<p>Optional parameters:
- <code>is_DC</code>: <em>yes</em>, flag if the connection is counted as non-synchronous for the possible non-synchronous limit. If <code>is_DC</code> (direct current) is yes, then the connection is non-synchronous. More at: How-to create a non-synchronous limit
- <code>transfer_method</code>: Four options: <em>regular</em> (default), <em>exact</em>, <em>variable_cost_only</em>, <em>no_losses_no_variable_cost</em>. </p>
<p>In most cases <em>regular</em> should be used. The downside of it is that it allows the flows to both directions at the same time, but the model does this only in specific circumstances when its beneficial to leak energy through the connection losses. For example, if connection capacity is 500 and efficiency 0.8, both nodes can send 500, but recive only 400 reducing the incoming energy by 100 in both nodes without any cost.
Typically the model does not want to produce extra energy as it usually has costs, but it can happen if there is a cost to curtailing energy generation from a free source or if a unit is forced to generate at some level ('e.g. using <code>profile_method</code>: 'equal').</p>
<p><em>Exact</em> method does not allow flow in both directions at the same time, but it requires a binary variable, which will be computationally heavier (especially if the model would otherwise be fully linear). </p>
<p><em>Variable_cost_only</em> can be used when there are no losses associated with the flow. It allows costs related to the flow, but if losses are to be included, it should not be used.</p>
<p>The <em>no_losses_no_variable_cost</em> can be used when the connection has no losses and no variable costs accociated with the flow. It is computationally the most efficient method, as it uses only one variable for the flow (the variable becomes negative for the other direction, but this can work only when there are no losses or variable costs). It also prevents simultanoues flow to both directions.</p>
<p>The results of connections can be seen from the node_balance table. However, these are the results from all the connections connected to the node. If you want to have the results from an individual connection or specified connections, you can create a group of connection_nodes (<code>group_connection_node</code>) with a parameter <code>output_results</code> set to <em>yes</em>. This will produce sum_flow` results from the connection to the node. </p>
<p>The example database shows a connection between a two node system where the other node has a wind power plant and the other node has a coal power plant. </p>
<p><img alt="Connections" src="../connections.PNG" /></p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-the-demand-in-a-node">How to set the demand in a node</h2>
<p><strong>(demand.sqlite)</strong></p>
<p>The demand in a node is set with the inflow parameter. When the node is consuming energy or matter, the values should be negative and when the node is supplying energy (or matter) the values should be positive.
The inflow parameter accepts two types of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant</li>
<li>Timeseries map</li>
</ul>
<p>If the model is using multiple periods, then the same timeseries profile is used for every period. However, the inflow can be scaled for different periods with the <code>inflow_method</code> parameter:
- <code>scale_to_annual_flow</code>: This will multiply the demand with a constant to make the summed inflow to match the <code>annual_flow</code>. This requires the node parameter <code>annual_flow</code> that is a map of periods containing the annual flow for each period. The sum of inflows is divided by the period's share of the year (hours in period /8760) before scaling (so that the annual energy demand/supply matches the <code>annual_flow</code> no matter what parts of the year are used to represent the full year). 
- <code>scale_in_proportion</code>: calculates a scaling factor by dividing <code>annual_flow</code> with the sum of time series inflow (after it has been annualized using <code>timeline_duration_in_years</code>). This does not force the demand/supply to match annual flow in case the representative periods are not representing the full year, but the time series will still be scaled to capture the proportional change in the <code>annual_flow</code> parameter. 
- <code>scale_to_annual_and_peak_flow</code>: The inflow scaled so that the peak is at the given <code>peak_flow</code> and the inflow sums to annual flow of the period. This is done by the following equation:</p>
<pre><code>new_inflow = (peak/peak_old)*(1+c)*old_inflow-peak*c

where c = 
[(peak/peak_old)*(8760/hours_in_period)*sum(old_inflow) - annual_flow] 
/ [peak*8760 - (peak/peak_old)*(8760/hours_in_period)*sum(old_inflow)]
</code></pre>
<p>Examples of all these options are shown in the demand.sqlite.</p>
<p><img alt="Demand" src="../Demand.PNG" /></p>
<h2 id="how-to-add-a-storage-unit-battery">How to add a storage unit (battery)</h2>
<p><strong>(init.sqlite, scenario: wind_battery)</strong>
<strong><em>init - west - wind - battery</em></strong></p>
<p>In the <strong><em>Init</em></strong> SQLite database, there is a <code>scenario</code> <em>wind_battery</em>.
In the example, the <em>wind_plant</em> alone is not able to meet the load in all conditions, but the <em>battery</em> will help it to improve the situation.</p>
<p>In FlexTool, only <code>nodes</code> can have storage. <code>Nodes</code> can therefore be demand nodes, storage nodes or both. To make a storage node one the required parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_balance</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_storage</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>existing</code>: The maximum storage size of battery as the potential energy [MWh]</li>
<li><code>penalty_up</code>: a large number to prefer not creating energy from nowhere</li>
<li><code>penalty_down</code>: a large number to prefer not creating energy from nowhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>self_discharge_loss</code> The fraction of energy loss in each hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storage states can be tied to a value. For this three methods are introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>storage_start_end_method</code>: Fixes start and/or end state of the storage to a chosen value. This is for the start and the end of the whole model timeline (not for individual solves in case the model is rolling forward).<ul>
<li><code>storage_state_start</code> and <code>storage_state_end</code> set these values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>storage_bind_method</code>: Forces the start and end values to be the same for the chosen  time interval (timeblock, period or solve)</li>
<li><code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code>: Fixes the state of the storage at the end of the solve horizon or sets a price for the stored energy at the end of the solve horizon<ul>
<li><code>storage_state_reference_value</code> and <code>storage_state_reference_price</code> set these values</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having multiple storage methods can create infeasible problems. This is why some of the combinations shouldn't (and cannot) be used at the same time. If multiple methods are used, some of them might be ignored by the method hierarchy. More information can be found from <a href="https://irena-flextool.github.io/flextool/reference">Model Parameters: Using nodes as storages</a>. </p>
<p>Battery also needs charging and discharging capabilities. These could be presented either with a <code>connection</code> or by having a charging <code>unit</code> and a discharging <code>unit</code>. In here, we are using a <code>connection</code> called <em>battery_inverter</em>. Please note that the <code>efficiency</code> parameter of the <code>connection</code> applies to both directions, so the round-trip <code>efficiency</code> will be <code>efficiency</code> squared.</p>
<p>The <code>transfer_method</code> can be used by all types of connections, but in this case it is best to choose <em>regular</em>, which tries to avoid simultaneous charging and discharing, but can still do it when the model needs to dissipate energy. <em>exact</em> method would prevent that, but it would require integer variables and make the storage computationally much more expensive. Model leakage will be reported in the results (forthcoming).</p>
<p>The required paremeters of the connection are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>existing</code>: The capacity of energy transsmission [MW]</li>
<li><code>transfer_method</code>: (see above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>efficiency</code>: by default 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally <code>connection_node_node</code> relationship is needed between inverter, the battery and the demand node (west). </p>
<p><img alt="Add a battery" src="../battery.png" /></p>
<h2 id="how-to-add-investment-parameters-to-a-storageunit">How to add investment parameters to a storage/unit</h2>
<p><strong>(init.sqlite scenario: wind_battery_invest)</strong>
<strong><em>init - west - wind - battery - battery_invest</em></strong></p>
<p>Here we will use the previous battery scenario to represent the investment options in the tool.</p>
<p>The solve will invest only if it has an array of <code>invest_periods</code> set, telling the periods where it is allowed to make investment decisions. In a multi solve investment model (rolling investments) it can be useful to separately set <code>invest_realized_periods</code> so that the investment results get reported only from the chosen periods from each solve (in order to avoid overlapping reporting of investment decisions that are replaced by  investment decisions in later solves). Furthermore, <code>realized_periods</code> will define the solves and periods from which the dispatch results are output into results.</p>
<p>First, the investment parameters need to be included both for the <em>battery_inverter</em> and <em>battery</em> objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>invest_method</code> - the modeller needs to choose between <em>only_invest</em>, <em>only_retire</em>, <em>invest_and_retire</em> or <em>not_allowed</em></li>
<li><code>invest_cost</code> - overnight investment cost new capacity [currency/kW] for the <em>battery_inverter</em> and [currency/kWh] for the <em>battery</em>. Other one can be left empty or zero, since they will be tied together in the next phase. Here we will assume a fixed relation between kW and kWh for this battery technology, but for example flow batteries could have separate investments for storage and charging capacities.</li>
<li><code>interest_rate</code> - an interest rate [e.g. 0.05 means 5%] for the technology that is sufficient to cover capital costs. The chosen interest rate should reflect the assumption that in the model economic lifetime equals the technical lifetime.</li>
<li><code>lifetime</code> - technical lifetime of the technology to calculate investment annuity (together with the interest rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional parameters:
- <code>invest_max_total</code>: maximum investment (power [MW] or energy [MWh]) to the virtual capacity of a group of units or to the storage capacity of a group of nodes. 
    - In the same way investment limits can be set for total and period, investment and retirement, min and max
- <code>lifetime_method</code>: Model can either be forced to reinvest when the lifetime ends <code>reinvest_automatic</code> or have a choice <code>reinvest_choice</code>
- <code>salvage_value</code>: Sets the extra value that can be gained for retiring [CUR/kW]
- <code>fixed_cost</code>: Annual cost for capacity [CUR/kW]
- <code>retire_forced</code>: forces to retire at least this amount of capacity</p>
<p>In many cases some of the investment decisions are tied to each other. Here the battery capacity and the connection capacity of the <em>battery_inverter</em> will be tied as they are simultaneously limited by the choice of the battery technology to be invested in.
To model this, a new constraint needs to be created that ties together the storage capacity of the <em>battery</em> and the charging/discharging capacity of the <em>battery_inverter</em>. A new <code>constraint</code> object <em>battery_tie_kW_kWh</em> is created and it is given parameters <code>constant</code>, <code>is_active</code> and <code>sense</code>. Constant could be left out, since it is zero, but <code>is_active</code> must be defined in order to include the constraint in the <em>battery_invest</em> <code>alternative</code>. The <code>sense</code> of the constraint must be <em>equal</em> to enforce the kw/kWh relation.</p>
<p>Both <em>battery_inverter</em> and <em>battery</em> need a coefficient to tell the model how they relate to each other. The equation has the capacity variables on the left side of the equation and the constant on the right side.</p>
<pre><code>sum_i(`constraint_capacity_coefficient` * `invested_capacity`) = `constant` 
      where i is any unit, connection or node that is part of the constraint
</code></pre>
<p>When the <code>constraint_capacity_coefficient</code> for <em>battery</em> is set at 1 and for the <em>battery_inverter</em> at -8, then the equation will force <em>battery_inverter</em> <code>capacity</code> to be 8 times smaller than the <em>battery</em> <code>capacity</code>. The negative term can be arranged to the right side of the equation, which yields:</p>
<p><code>1 x *battery* = 8 x *battery_inverter*, which can be true only if *battery_inverter* is 1/8 of *battery*</code></p>
<p><code>constraint_capacity_coefficient</code> is not a parameter with a single value, but a map type parameter (index: constraint name, value: coefficient). It allows the object to participate in multiple constraints.</p>
<p>Finally, FlexTool can actually mix three different types of constraint coefficients: <code>constraint_capacity_coefficient</code>, <code>constraint_state_coefficient</code> and <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> allowing the user to create custom constraints between any types of objects in the model for the main variables in the model (<em>flow</em>, <em>state</em> as well as <em>invest</em> and <em>divest</em>). So, the equation above is in full form:</p>
<pre><code>  + sum_i [constraint_capacity_coefficient(i) * invested_capacity]
           where i contains [node, unit, connection] belonging to the constraint
  + sum_j [constraint_flow_coefficient(j) * capacity]
           where j contains [unit--node, connection--node] belonging to the constraint
  + sum_k [constraint_state_coefficient(k) * capacity] 
           where k contains [node] belonging to the constraint
  = 
  constant

  where 'capacity' is existing capacity plus invested capacity
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-to-create-combined-heat-and-power-chp">How to create combined heat and power (CHP)</h2>
<p><strong>(init.sqlite scenario: coal_chp)</strong>
<strong><em>init - west - coal_chp - heat</em></strong></p>
<p>First, a new <em>heat</em> <code>node</code> is added with the necessary parameters. The <code>nodes</code> can be used for energy form of energy or matter, so the heat demand node does not differ from the electricity demand node. </p>
<p>The required parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_balance</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>inflow</code>: Map for the heat demand (negative) [MW]</li>
<li><code>penalty_up</code>: a large number to prefer not creating energy from nowhere</li>
<li><code>penalty_down</code>: a large number to prefer not creating energy from nowhere</li>
</ul>
<p>The heating systems tend to have some level of storage capability, so one could also add storage parameters to the node as well, but here they are not used.</p>
<p>Then the <em>coal_chp</em> <code>unit</code> is made with a high <code>efficiency</code> parameter, since CHP units convert fuel energy to power and heat at high overall rates. In FlexTool, <code>efficiency</code> is a property of the unit - it demarcates at what rate the sum of inputs is converted to the sum of outputs. However, without any additional constraints, the <code>unit</code> is free to choose in what proportion to use inputs and in what proportion to use outputs. In units with only one input and output, this freedom does not exist, but in here, the <em>coal_chp</em> needs to be constrained as otherwise the unit could produce only electricity and no heat at 90% efficiency, which is not feasible. </p>
<p>This CHP plant is an another example where the user defined <code>constraint</code> (see the last equation in the previous example) is used to achieve the desired behaviour. In a backpressure CHP, heat and power outputs are fixed - increase one of them, and you must also increase the other. In an extraction CHP plant the relation is more complicated - there is an allowed operating area between heat and power. Both can be represented in FlexTool, but here a backpressure example is given. An extraction plant would require two or more <em>greater_than</em> and/or <em>lesser_than</em> <code>constraints</code> to define an operating area.</p>
<p>Electricity and heat outputs are fixed by adding a new <code>constraint</code> <em>coal_chp_fix</em> where the heat and power co-efficients are fixed. You need to create the two relationships <code>unit__outputNode</code>, for <em>coal_chp--heat</em> and <em>coal_chp--west</em>. As can be seen in the bottom part of the figure below, the <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> parameter for the <em>coal_chp--heat</em> and <em>coal_chp--west</em> is set as a map value where the <code>constraint</code> name matches with the <em>coal_chp_fix</em> <code>constraint</code> object name. The values are set so that the constraint equation forces the heat output to be twice as large as the electricity output.</p>
<p>Create constraint  <em>coal_chp_fix</em> object with parameters:
- <code>is_active</code>: yes
- <code>sense</code>: equal
- <code>constant</code>: 0.0</p>
<p>Create <code>unit_outputNode</code> (coal_chp|heat):
- <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> : <em>coal_chp_fix</em>, -0.5</p>
<p>Create <code>unit_outputNode</code> (coal_chp|west):
- <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> : <em>coal_chp_fix</em>, 2</p>
<p>Again, the negative value can be turned positive by arranging it to the right side of the equality, creating this:</p>
<pre><code>1 x *electricity* = 0.5 x *heat*, which is true only if *heat* is 2 x *electricity*
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-hydro-reservoir">How to create a hydro reservoir</h2>
<p><strong>hydro_reservoir.sq</strong></p>
<pre><code>Note! This example concerns a single reservoir hydro power plant. 
If the river system has multiple plants in a series and their operations are tied, 
then multiple nodes and units are needed to represent the system.
</code></pre>
<p>The objective is to create a hydro power plant with a reservoir and connect it to a demand node.</p>
<p>Hydro reservoir power plant requires three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reservoir <code>node</code></li>
<li>Hydro <code>unit</code></li>
<li>Output <code>node</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It can be useful to create a new alternative for these components to be able to include and exclude them from the scenarios.</p>
<p>The reservoir is made with a node as only nodes can have storage in FlexTool. The incoming water can be represented by the inflow parameter. It can be a constant or a time variant. The unit of the inflow should be the power that can be created from the quantity of the incoming water at maximum efficiency [MW]. In the same way, the existing storage capacity should be the maximum amount of stored energy that the reservoir can hold [MWh].
In this implementation of reservoir hydro power, there is an option to spill water (energy) from the storage so that it does not run through the plant. The simplest way of allowing spilling is setting the downward penalty of the node to 0. This way the energy can disappear from the storage without a cost. The quantity of spilled energy can be seen from the results as the 'downward slack' of the node.</p>
<p>The required parameters of the reservoir node are (node_c and node_t sheets if using Excel input data):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_balance</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_storage</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>inflow</code>: Mapping of the incoming water as the potential power [MW]</li>
<li><code>existing</code>: The maximum size of the reservoir as the potential energy [MWh]</li>
<li><code>penalty_up</code>: a large number to prefer not creating energy from nowhere</li>
<li><code>penalty_down</code>: 0 or a large number (spilling or not)</li>
<li>a <code>storage_method</code> to set the behaviour on how the storage levels should be managed - for short duration storages <em>bind_within_timeblock</em> may be best and for seasonal storages it could be best to use <em>bind_within_solve</em>. If historical storage level time series are available, it can be beneficial to use <em>fix_start</em> in the <code>storage_start_end_method</code> together with <code>storage_solve_horizon_method</code> <em>use_reference_value</em>, which will pick the storage level at the end of each solve from the time series provided as a reference (<em>storage_state_reference_value</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>unit</code> is connected to the <em>reservoir</em> <code>node</code> and the output <code>node</code> <em>nodeA</em> (unit_c and unit_node_c in excel):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>efficiency</code> of the unit can be set to 1 as the inflow time series are directly expressed in MWh (using piecewise linear efficiency is naturally possible).</li>
<li>Set <code>existing</code> capacity [MW]</li>
<li><code>is_active</code>: yes </li>
<li>Create relations <code>unit__inputNode</code>: <em>hydro_plant</em>|<em>reservoir</em> and <code>unit__outputNode</code>: <em>hydro_plant</em>|<em>nodeA</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-hydro-pump-storage">How to create a hydro pump storage</h2>
<p><strong>(hydro_with_pump.sqlite)</strong></p>
<p>For a hydro pump storage one needs the following components:
- Demand <code>node</code> 
- hydro_plant <code>unit</code> with 
- storage <code>node</code>, 
- hydro_pump <code>unit</code> with 
- pump storage <code>node</code> 
- a source for external energy (pumped storage plant will lose energy due to charging losses)</p>
<p>For the demand node and the hydro plant we will use the same components as in the previous hydro_reservoir example. With the difference that both demand and hydro_plant capacities are doubled. Wind power plant will be used as a source for external energy.</p>
<p>First create the pump_storage. This is the downstream storage from the hydro plant. Again it should have the parameters as the reservoir:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_active</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_balance</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>has_storage</code>: yes</li>
<li><code>existing</code>: The maximum size of the storage [MWh]. Note that this really represents the mass of the water and it should be converted as the potential of the energy of the reservoir-plant system. So that 1 liter of water has the same energy in both storages.</li>
<li><code>penalty_up</code>: a large number to avoid creating energy from nowhere</li>
<li><code>penalty_down</code>: 0 </li>
</ul>
<p>In this example database, we have both a closed system and a river system. The difference is that in the closed system the inflow is zero in both reservoir and pump_storage. In river system we have the incoming water for the reservoir as in the reservoir example. In the downstream pump storage we implement a outflow as the negative inflow representing the minimum amount of water that has to flow out of the system at each timestep to not dry out the river. The <code>penalty_down</code> is set as 0 to allow it let more water go when it needs to, otherwise the storages will keep filling up if the incoming water is larger than the minimum outgoing water.</p>
<p>The storage level fixes should be the same in both storages (reservoir and pump storage). Here:
- <code>fix_start_end_method</code>: <em>fix_start</em>
- <code>storage_state_start</code>: 0.5
- <code>bind_storage_method</code>: <em>bind_with_timeblock</em></p>
<p>This sets the starting storage levels to be 50%. The binding will also constrain the state of the storage at the end of of each timeblock to be the same as in the beginning of the timeblock.</p>
<p>Then create the pump unit. It only needs three parameters:
- <code>efficiency</code> = 1, The real efficiency of the pump is set elsewhere, so use 1.0 here. 
- <code>existing</code>: The wanted capacity
- <code>is_active</code>: <em>yes</em> </p>
<p>Set the relationships as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unit_outputNode</code> for (hydro_plant | nodeA), (hydro_plant | pump_storage ), (hydro_pump | reservoir)</li>
<li><code>unit_inputNode</code> for (hydro_plant | reservoir), (hydro_pump | pump_storage), (hydro_pump | nodeA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your system should look something like:</p>
<p><img alt="Hydro pump" src="../hydro_pump.PNG" /></p>
<p>Next comes the tricky part of preserving the water and energy as both are represented as generic energy in the model. This is done by setting extra coefficents and constraints to the flows. First the hydro_plant needs to both create the energy for the demand node and pass the mass to the pump_storage. This is done by doubling the efficiency in this example to 2 and setting a extra constraint to force the output flows to both the demand node and the storage to be the same. </p>
<p>For the hydro plant:
- <code>Efficiency</code>:  2 </p>
<p>Create a new constraint (here <em>plant_storage_nodeA_split</em>) and add the parameters:
- <code>is_active</code>: yes
- <code>sense</code>: equal
- <code>constant</code>: 0.0</p>
<p>And for the <code>unit_outputNodes</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(hydro_plant | nodeA) <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> Map: plant_storage_nodeA_split , 1</li>
<li>(hydro_plant | pump_storage) <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> Map: plant_storage_nodeA_split , -1</li>
<li>Meaning: </li>
</ul>
<pre><code>flow to nodeA - flow to pump_storage = 0
</code></pre>
<p>As for the pump storage, we will have to make sure that the same amount of water leaves the pump_storage and enters the reservoir. Also it still should use electricity from the demand node without increasing the amount of water that is moving from storage to another. 
First to prevent the energy from the demand node from increasing the water flow, add a coefficient to the flow between the demand node and the pump.</p>
<p><code>unit_inputNode</code> (hydro_pump|nodeA):
- <code>Coefficient</code>: 0 (Default is 1) </p>
<p>This prevents the water amount from increasing as:</p>
<pre><code>unit_output_flow = coeff1 * unit_input_flow1 + coeff2 * unit_input_flow2.
</code></pre>
<p>We still have to make the unit to consume electricity even though it does not affect the unit output directly. This is done by setting a new constraint to tie the flows to the pump unit from pump storage and the nodeA. Add a constraint (here <em>pump_storage_nodeA_fix</em>) the with the parameters:
- <code>is_active</code>: yes
- <code>sense</code>: equal
- <code>constant</code>: 0.0</p>
<p>And setting parameters for <code>unit_outputNode</code> and <code>unit_inputNode</code>:
- (hydro_pump | nodeA) <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> Map: plant_storage_nodeA_split , 2
- (hydro_pump | pump_storage) <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> Map: plant_storage_nodeA_split , -1</p>
<pre><code>2 * flow_from_nodeA - flow_from_pump_storage = 0
</code></pre>
<p>Note that here the (<code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> Map: plant_storage_nodeA_split , 2) actually sets the efficiency of the pump. 
This means that here only half of the electricity used by the pump can be recovered when that amount of water is used by the hydro_plant. (Two units of energy are used to move 1 unit of water_energy)
The <code>constraint_flow_coefficient</code> for pump_input should therefore be (1/efficiency)</p>

<h2 id="how-to-add-a-minimum-load-start-up-and-ramp">How to add a minimum load, start-up and ramp</h2>
<p><strong>(ramp_and_start_up.sqlite)</strong></p>
<p>Some plants cannot vary their output freely, but have some cost and limits associated with it. In this example we will add the minimum load behaviour to a <em>coal_plant</em> <code>unit</code> and add the cost and limits for starting up and ramping the plant respectively.</p>
<p>Minimum load requires that the unit must have an online variable in addition to flow variables and therefore a <code>startup_method</code> needs to be defined and an optional <code>startup_cost</code> can be given. The <code>startup_cost</code> is added to the total cost every time the unit is required to start-up. Here we use a value 1000 (Currency/MW started up).</p>
<p>The options for the <code>startup_method</code> are <em>no_startup</em>, <em>linear</em> and <em>binary</em>. <em>binary</em> would require an integer variable so <em>linear</em> is chosen. However, this means that the unit can startup partially. The minimum online will still apply, but it is the minimum of the online capacity in any given moment (<em>flow</em> &gt;= <em>min_load</em> x <em>capacity</em> x <em>online</em>), where 0 &lt;= <em>online</em> &lt;= 1.</p>
<p>The online variable also allows to change the efficiency of the plant between the minimum and full loads. A unit with a part-load efficiency will obey the following equation:</p>
<pre><code>  + sum_i[ input(i) * input_coefficient(i) ]
  =
  + sum_o[ output(o) * output_coefficient(o) ] * slope
  + online * section

where   slope = 1 / efficiency - section
  and section = 1 / efficiency 
                - ( 1 / efficiency - min_load / efficiency_at_min_load) / ( 1 - min_load )
</code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>input_coefficient</code> and <code>output_coefficient</code> are 1, but if there is a need to tweak their relative contributions, these coefficients allow to do so (e.g. a coal plant might have lower efficiency when using lignite than when using brown coal).</p>
<p>The input is required at different ouput levels is shown in the figure below, when Capacity = 100, Efficiency = 0.8, Minimum load = 0.6 and Efficiency at minimum load = 0.5.</p>
<p><img alt="Min load figure" src="../Minimum_load.png" /></p>
<p>Next we will add ramp limits. With the ramping limits, the user can force the change of a flow from a unit to be below a certain value each timestep. The ramping is an attribute of the flow. Therefore it does not require the minimum load behaviour and its parameters are added to the <code>unit_outputNode</code> relationship:
- <code>ramp_method</code>: ramp_cost, ramp_limit or both. Only ramp limit is currently implemented (August 2023).
- <code>ramp_speed_up</code>: Limit on how fast the plant can ramp up. (fraction of unit / min) ie. Value 0.01 allows the change of 60% of capacity per hour. 
- <code>ramp_speed_down</code>: Limit on how fast the plant can ramp down. (fraction of unit / min) ie. Value 0.01 allows the change of 60% of capacity per hour.
- <code>ramp_cost</code>: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. The cost of ramping the capacity. [CUR/MW] </p>

<h2 id="how-to-add-co2-emissions-costs-and-limits">How to add CO2 emissions, costs and limits</h2>
<p><strong>(init.sqlite scenario: coal_co2 )</strong>
<strong><em>init - west - coal - co2_price - co2_limit</em></strong></p>
<p>Carbon dioxide emissions are added to FlexTool by associating relevant <code>commodities</code> (e.g. <em>coal</em>) with a <code>co2_content</code> parameter (CO2 content per MWh of energy contained in the fuel). 
The other CO2 parameters are handeled through a group of nodes (Here <em>coal_price</em> or <em>coal_limit</em> <code>groups</code>). Therefore one needs to create a group and add all the nodes that supply these commodities to a group with a <code>group_node</code> relationship. (Here the relationship <em>co2_price--coal_market</em>)
To set a price one needs to create set the co2_method parameter to <em>price</em> (constant) and create the <code>co2_price</code> parameter with the desired value. This price is added to the price of the commodity. </p>
<p>Alternatively one can set a limit on the co2 used by setting the <code>co2_method</code> parameter to <em>period</em> and setting the <code>co2_max_period</code> (periodic map) parameter. If both methods <em>price</em> and <em>period</em> are to be used, then they need to use different <code>groups</code>. The groups can include the same <code>nodes</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="Add CO2" src="../coal_co2.png" /></p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-non-synchronous-limit">How to create a non-synchronous limit</h2>
<p><strong>(non_sync_and_curtailment.sqlite)</strong>
<strong><em>(scenario: non_sync)</em></strong></p>
<p>Non-synchronous limit is a property of a <code>group</code> of nodes. It states that the non-synchronous flow to the node cannot exceed a set share of the input flows at any timestep. To demonstrate this we have set a system with a coal plant, a wind plant and a single demand node. However, it can be done to a group of nodes with unlimited amount of plants or connections connected. So, one can limit the share on invdividual nodes and the whole system.</p>
<p>The non-synchronous limit is set to a <code>group</code> of nodes with one or multiple members. Note: These are set to the group with <code>group_node</code> relationship, not with <code>group_node_unit</code> relationship!</p>
<p>Create a group (here <em>nodeA_group</em>) and set a <code>group_node</code> relationship (nodeA_group |nodeA). Then add parameters:
- <code>has_non_synchronous</code> : yes
- <code>non_synchronous_limit</code>: 0.5
- <code>penalty_non_synchronous</code>: 4000</p>
<p>This forces the non-sync flow to be at max 50% of the incoming flow to the nodeA. 
The penalty should be always set as in some cases there is no other way to keep the constraint feasible (and it will be difficult to find the reason why the model does not solve). The existance of the non-synchrounous penalty in your results indicates that this constraint has been violated and you should investigate the reason for this in your system. If the <code>penalty_non_synchronous</code> is lower than the <code>upward_penalty</code> of the demand <code>node</code>, the system will prefer breaking the non-sync constraint instead of the <code>node</code> balance equation. In other words it will not curtail the production of <code>profile</code> plants if the demand is not satisfied even though it will break the non-synchronous penalty. If it is higher, the curtailment will take place instead.</p>
<p>Then set which plants and connections are considered non-synchronous by adding a parameters:
<code>unit_outputNode</code>:
- <code>is_non_synchronous</code>: yes </p>
<p><code>Connection_node_node</code>:
- <code>is_DC</code>: yes </p>
<p>Here the (wind_plant|nodeA) has the <code>is_non_synchronous</code> parameter.</p>
<p>If you want to see the individual flows in the results you can create separate <code>groups</code> for the flows and add <code>group_unit_node</code> relations to it. To produce the flow results, the groups need the parameter 
- <code>output_results</code>: yes </p>
<p>Here we have <em>coal_flow</em> <code>group</code> with <code>group_unit_node</code> relation coal_flow|coal_plant|nodeA
and <em>wind_flow</em> <code>group</code> with <code>group_unit_node</code> relation wind_flow|wind_plant|nodeA.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-see-the-vre-curtailment-and-vre-share-results-for-a-node">How to see the VRE curtailment and VRE share results for a node</h2>
<p><strong>(non_sync_and_curtailment.sqlite)</strong>
<strong><em>(scenario: curtailment)</em></strong></p>
<p>When the system has profile-units with the <code>profile_method</code>: upper_limit, the model can curtail the unit's flow to avoid penalties.</p>
<p>The curtailment could take place for several reasons:
- the supply is higher than the demand and the energy cannot be stored or transferred (further)
- non-synchronous limit
- extra flow constraints have been set
- other unit specific constraint affecting how VRE units or other units are forced to behave (ramp, start-up ...)</p>
<p>To see the curtailment results you need to add a <code>group</code> of nodes (<code>group_node</code> not <code>group_unit_node</code> !) with one or more members. The group then needs the parameter:
- <code>output_results</code>: yes</p>
<p>This produces the <code>group</code>: <em>indicator</em> result to the Results database and <em>group_summary</em> table to the excel.</p>
<p>These changes were done to the previous non-sync example database. </p>
<p>Note: The results are the share of curtailment in relation to the inflow (demand) so it can exceed 100% as seen in the figure.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-multi-year-model">How to create a multi-year model</h2>
<p><strong>(init.sqlite scenario: multi_year / multi_year_one_solve)</strong>
<strong><em>init - west - wind - coal - coal_invest - 5weeks - multi-year - multi_year_one_solve</em></strong></p>
<p>A multi-year model is constructed from multiple periods, each presenting one year. In the example case, each year is otherwise the same, but the demand is increasing in the <em>west</em> <code>node</code>. This means that all periods can use the same timeblockset <em>5weeks</em> from the same timeline <em>y2020</em>, but one can also make separate timelines for each year, if data is available for this. The <code>inflow</code> time series are scaled to match the value in <code>annual_flow</code> that is mapped for each period. The model is using the <code>inflow_method</code> <em>scale_to_annual</em> in order to achieve this (default is <em>use_original</em> that would not perform scaling). There should also be a <code>discount_rate</code> parameter set for the <code>model</code> object <em>flexTool</em> if something else than the model default of 5% (0.05 value) is to be used.</p>
<p><img alt="Multi-year model data" src="../multi_year_solves.png" /></p>
<p>A multi-year model could be solved at one go (multi_year_one_solve) or by rolling through several solves (multi-year) where each solve has a foresight horizon and a realisation horizon as can be seen from the figure below. In this example, the model rolls through several solves and therefore, in the figure above, the <code>model</code> object <em>flexTool</em> has four values in the <code>solves</code> array. Each value respresents one solve and it's position in the sequence of solves. </p>
<p><img alt="One vs multi solve" src="../one_multi_solve.png" /></p>
<p>Next figure shows the values needed to define one solve (out of the four solves in the example). All of these need to be repeated for each solve in the model.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>years_represented</code> parameter is used by the model to calculate the discounting factors for the periods in the model (often future years). It should  state the number of years each period will be representing. For example, a period for 2025 could represent the years 2025-2029 if its <code>years_represented</code> is set to 5. Any investments would be take place at the start of 2025 and discounted to the beginning of 2025, but the operational costs would accrue from each year in 2025-2029 each with a different discounting factor (decreasing based on the interest rate).</li>
<li><code>invest_periods</code> the periods in which the model is allowed to make investments. To be given for each solve.</li>
<li><code>realized_periods</code> the periods that will be realized in this solve (outputs dispatch results for these periods). To be given for each solve.</li>
<li><code>invest_realized_periods</code> parameter states the periods that will realize the investment decisions. If not stated, it will use <code>realized_periods</code>.</li>
<li><code>period_timeblockset</code> defines the set of representative 'periods' (timeblocks in FlexTool) to be used in each FlexTool <code>period</code>.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-use-cplex-as-the-solver">How to use CPLEX as the solver</h2>
<p>Using CPLEX requires that you have installed the software, have a licence for it and have added it to PATH or to the environment where you are using the FlexTool, so that the tool can find the solver.</p>
<p>CPLEX is used when the <strong>solve</strong> parameter <em>solver</em> is set to 'cplex'. The tool passes the built optimization model to the CPLEX solver and converts the solution file to a filetype suitalbe for CPLEX. The solver will produce two additional files to the work directory: 'cplex.log' and 'flexModel3_cplex.sol'. The former is the logfile of the solver and the latter contains the solution in the CPLEX format.</p>
<p>The tool uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/12.8.0.0?topic=cplex-interactive-optimizer">Interactive Optimizer</a> to pass the problem to the solver. The default command used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cplex -c 'read flexModel3.mps' 'opt' 'write flexModel3_cplex.sol' 'quit'
</code></pre>
<p>Additional parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>solver_precommand</code> creates a text in front of the cplex call. This is useful when dealing with floating licences. The command allows to call the licence server to reserve the licence for the duration of the cplex program with a command line argument.</li>
<li><code>solver_arguments</code> is an array containing additional CPLEX solver commands</li>
</ul>
<p>With these parameters, the command line call is:</p>
